# AI-Powered Fraud Detection Tools

## Overview

This repository showcases the design and development of **AI-Powered Fraud Detection Tools** at Mastercard, a project aimed at reducing false positives, improving transaction approval rates, and enhancing customer satisfaction. The project integrates AI technologies such as speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) for real-time decision-making, delivering tangible value to Mastercard's customers and business.

## üìä Market Research

We conducted an extensive analysis of the payment industry, focusing on:
- **Pain Points:** High false-positive rates in fraud detection systems leading to transaction declines and customer dissatisfaction.
- **Competitor Analysis:** Benchmarked fraud detection solutions offered by other leading financial institutions.
- **Market Trends:** Identified opportunities to integrate machine learning models for more accurate fraud detection and enhanced approval rates.

---

## üß† Hypothesis

If we integrate AI-driven fraud detection tools into Mastercard's platform, we can:
1. Reduce false-positive rates by at least 25%.
2. Increase transaction approval rates by at least 18%.
3. Enhance the overall customer experience and satisfaction.

## üë§ Personas

1. **Merchants:**
   - *Goal:* Minimize transaction declines and maximize revenue.
   - *Pain Point:* Lost sales due to incorrectly flagged transactions.
2. **Cardholders:**
   - *Goal:* Seamless payment experience without unnecessary declines.
   - *Pain Point:* Frustration due to valid transactions being flagged as fraudulent.
3. **Customer Service Representatives:**
   - *Goal:* Efficiently resolve fraud-related queries.
   - *Pain Point:* High volume of disputes stemming from inaccurate fraud detection.
